![illuminations-banner-02](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/276204/191124933-bea769ff-3007-4097-980e-9a0f12c78443.png)

This is the companion website to [illuminations.mit.edu](https://illuminations.mit.edu) It's built ontop of [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/), bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app) and uses TypeScript. Don't worry if you haven't used Typescript before! It's super easy to learn and really just adds a bunch of niceties.

This site is currently hosted deployed on Vercel, and you can see the live version of it on [learn.illuminations.mit.edu](https://learn.illuminations.mit.edu). Pull requests welcome!

## Setup And Development

1. [Clone this repo!](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository)
1. Navigate to the root using Terminal on a Mac, or some sort of bash shell if youre on a PC. Run ```yarn install``` (if you don't have yarn, you may need to [install it](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/lang/en/docs/install/#mac-stable). Yarn is a package management system and makes keeping track of versions easy.)
1. Next, you'll need to get the ```.env``` files from someone currently who has the app running. Probably Victor. Place the ```.env``` in the root of the project.
1. To run the development server, run: ```yarn dev```
1. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.
